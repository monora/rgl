# Simple extensions of Hal Fultons tool to show dependencies between ruby
# source files (see http://hypermetrics.com/rubyhacker/code/rdep/). The basic
# extensions can be found at the end of the function find_files.
#
# Source: http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/rgl/rgl/examples/rdep-rgl.rb
#
# Additionaly rdep-rgl.rb generates a graphics file named
# File.basename(ARGV[0]) + ".png".
#
# Requires RGL (http://rgl.sourceforge.net) and Graphviz

rdep - The Ruby Dependency Tool
Version 1.4

Hal E. Fulton
2 November 2002
Ruby's license

Purpose

  Determine the library files on which a specified Ruby file is dependent
  (and their location and availability).

Usage notes

  Usage: ruby rdep.rb sourcefile

  The sourcefile may or may not have a .rb extension.

  The directories in the $: array (which includes the RUBYLIB environment
  variable) are searched first. File extensions are currently searched for
  in this order: no extension, .rb, .o, .so, .dll (this may not be correct).

  If there are no detected dependencies, the program will give the
  message, "No dependencies found."

  If the program finds [auto]load and require statements that it can
  understand, it searches for the specified files. Any recognized Ruby
  source files (*.rb) are processed recursively in the same way. No attempt
  is made to open the files that appear to be binary.

  The program will print up to four lists (any or all may be omitted):
    1. A list of files it found by going through RUBYLIB.;
    2. A list of files found under the searchroot (or under '.');
    3. A list of directories under searchroot which should perhaps be
       added to RUBYLIB; and
    4. A list of files (without extensions) which could not be found.

  If there were unparseable [auto]load or require statements, a warning
  will be issued.

  Between lists 3 and 4, the program will give an opinion about the overall
  situation. The worst case is that files were not found; the uncertain
  case is when there were unparseable statements; and the best case is
  when all files could be found (lists 1 and 2).

Exit codes

  0 - Usage or successful execution
  1 - Nonexistent sourcefile specified
  2 - Improper sourcefile (pipe, special file, ...)
  3 - Some kind of problem reading a file

Limitations

  Requires Ruby 1.6.0 or higher
  No recursion on binaries
  Can't look at dynamically built names
  Can't detect "tested" requires (e.g.: flag = require "foo.rb")
  [auto]load/require can be preceded only by whitespace on the line
  Only recognizes simple strings ("file" or 'file')
  Does not recognized named constants (e.g.: require MyFile)
  Assumes every directory entry is either a file or subdirectory
  Does not handle the Windows variable RUBYLIB_PREFIX
  May be SLOW if a directory structure is deep (especially
    on Windows with 1.6.x)

Known bugs:

  Logic may be incorrect in terms of search order, file extensions, etc.
  Injected a bug in 1.3: In rare cases will recurse until stack overflow

Revision history

  Version 1.0 - 13 October 2000  - Initial release
  Version 1.1 - 10 July 2001     - Bug fixes
  Version 1.2 - 15 August 2002   - Works correctly on Win98
  Version 1.3 - 21 October 2002  - Removed globals; removed search root;
                                   added $: instead of RUBYLIB; etc.
  Version 1.4 -  2 November 2002 - Fixed autoload recursion bug

To-do list

  Possibly change extension search order?
  Possibly add extensions to list?
  Are explicit extensions allowed other than .rb?
  Is a null extension really legal?
  Additional tests/safeguards? (file permissions, non-empty files,...)
  Change inconsistent expansion of tilde, dot, etc.?
  Make it smarter somehow??
