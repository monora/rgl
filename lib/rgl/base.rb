  # In BGL terminology the module Graph defines the graph concept (see
  # http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/graph_concepts.html). We however do not
  # distinguish between the IncidenceGraph, EdgeListGraph and VertexListGraph
  # concepts, which would complicate the interface too much. These concepts are
  # defined in BGL to differentiate between efficient access to edges and
  # vertices.
  #
  # The RGL Graph concept contains only a few requirements that are common to
  # all the graph concepts. These include, especially, the iterators defining
  # the sets of vertices and edges (see each_vertex and each_adjacent). Most
  # other functions are derived from these fundamental iterators, i.e.
  # num_vertices or num_edges.
  #
  # Each graph is an enumerable of vertices.
