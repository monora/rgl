# Module {RGL} defines the namespace for all modules and classes of the graph
# library. The main module is {Graph} which defines the abstract behavior of
# all graphs in the library. Other important modules or classes are:
#
# * Class {AdjacencyGraph} provides a concrete implementation of an undirected graph.
# * Module {Edge} defines edges of a graph.
# * {GraphIterator} and {GraphVisitor} provide support for iterating and searching.
# * {DOT} helps to visualize graphs.

    # parameters for representing edges (see {Graph#each_edge}). If a client wants to
    # store edges explicitly {DirectedEdge} or {UnDirectedEdge} instances are
    # returned (i.e. {Graph#edges}).

  # In _BGL_ terminology the module Graph defines the graph concept (see {Graph
  # Concepts}[https://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/graph_concepts.html]). We
  # however do not distinguish between the IncidenceGraph, EdgeListGraph and
  # VertexListGraph concepts, which would complicate the interface too much.
  # These concepts are defined in BGL to differentiate between efficient access
  # to edges and vertices.
  #
  # The RGL Graph concept contains only a few requirements that are common to
  # all the graph concepts. These include, especially, the iterators defining
  # the sets of vertices and edges (see {#each_vertex} and {#each_adjacent}). Most
  # other functions are derived from these fundamental iterators, i.e.
  # {#each_edge}, {#num_vertices} or {#num_edges}.
  #
  # Each graph is an enumerable of vertices.
