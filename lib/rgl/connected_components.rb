    # === Definition
    #
    # A _strongly connected component_ of a directed graph G=(V,E) is a
    # maximal set of vertices U which is in V, such that for every pair of
    # vertices u and v in U, we have both a path from u to v and a path
    # from v to u. That is to say, u and v are reachable from each other.
